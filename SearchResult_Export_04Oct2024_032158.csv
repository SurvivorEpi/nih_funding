Disparities along the cancer care continuum from diagnosis tosurvivorship can lead to distorted risk predictions; using these for decision-making may propagate andexacerbate biases that exist in clinical practice and result in poorer outcomes for certain subgroups.

However Theeffect of systemic anti-cancer therapy on human coronary microvascular function has not been evaluated andwe hypothesize that anti-cancer therapy mitochondrial DNA damage promotes mitochondrial dysfunction(including elevated free radical production and release of mitochondrial DNA fragments) which augmentstherapy-induced microvascular dysfunction. The overall goal of this application is to determine the role of telomerase specifically in the mitochondriain maintaining coronary vasodilation during external insult by chemotherapy.","9215648","BEYER, ANDREAS M","Not Applicable","04","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","937639060","E8VWJXMMUQ67","937639060","E8VWJXMMUQ67","US","43.04575","-88.020374","46001","MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN","MILWAUKEE","WI","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","532263548","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2024 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2025 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2024","693424"," ","NHLBI","449887","243537"," ","NHLBI","10866774","4/1/2024 12:00:00 AM","PA-20-185","1R01HL173549-01","1","R01","HL","173549","01"," ","DESVIGNE-NICKENS, PATRICE","4/1/2024 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2029 12:00:00 AM","Basic Biology of Blood, Heart and Vasculature Study Section [BBHV]"," ","693424",

To address these issues we will conduct aprospective cluster randomized trial of two models of cancer survivorship care in early-stage colorectal cancerand breast cancer survivors cared for in a community-based integrated health care setting. We will test theefficacy of an embedded PCP model (experimental condition) in which survivorship-trained PCPs areembedded within an oncology practice compared to the oncology physician model (usual care) that is thedefault condition in this healthcare system.","11231760","HAHN, ERIN ELIZABETH","Not Applicable","12","Unavailable","150829349","P1RTMASB37B5","150829349","P1RTMASB37B5","US","37.805769","-122.265214","3497005","KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE","Oakland","CA","Research Institutes","946123610","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2024 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2025 12:00:00 AM","353","Non-SBIR/STTR","2024","716227"," ","NCI","462544","253683"," ","NCI","10848217","5/13/2024 12:00:00 AM","RFA-CA-19-035","5R01CA249419-05","5","R01","CA","249419","05"," ","MOLLICA, MICHELLE A","6/1/2020 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2025 12:00:00 AM","ZCA1-SRB-K(J1)R"," ","716227",

As rural patients are less likely to receive care in urbancancer centers with cancer specialists who treat very large numbers of cancer patients an effective strategyused by the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center has been to share their expertise and resourceswith smaller community hospitals across Kentucky to help improve their quality of care. We propose to studythe Kentucky model in order to identify and characterize its core functions (i.e. what made it effective inimproving quality of care in community hospitals) adapt it to a new rural setting and determine its value to thehospitals and impact on cancer care.","9839628","CHARLTON, MARY E.","Not Applicable","01","PUBLIC HEALTH & PREV MEDICINE","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2024 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2025 12:00:00 AM","393","Non-SBIR/STTR","2024","681297"," ","NCI","473913","207384"," ","NCI","10835884","3/25/2024 12:00:00 AM","RFA-CA-19-064","5R01CA254628-04","5","R01","CA","254628","04"," ","WEAVER, SALLIE JAYNE","4/1/2021 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2026 12:00:00 AM","ZCA1-TCRB-T(O1)"," ","681297",

Amphiregulin is apro-fibrotic protein that is highly expressed in the bladder after radiation therapy and thus we hypothesizethat amphiregulin mediates radiation-induced bladder fibrosis and can serve as a predictive marker forradiation cystitis. The successful outcomes of this study will determine if amphiregulin is a viable therapeutictarget for radiation-induced fibrosis which will also be relevant for other benign bladder conditionscharacterized by a fibrotic bladder.","14592577","ZWAANS, BERNADETTE MARGARETHA MARIA","Not Applicable","11","Unavailable","076362110","KJWYBQN9STL7","076362110","KJWYBQN9STL7","US","42.517671","-83.190969","2059103","WILLIAM BEAUMONT HOSPITAL RESEARCH INST","ROYAL OAK","MI","Research Institutes","480736757","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2024 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2025 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2024","437368"," ","NIDDK","287742","149626"," ","NIDDK","10820643","6/4/2024 12:00:00 AM","PA-20-185","5R01DK135986-02","5","R01","DK","135986","02"," ","MULLINS, CHRISTOPHER V","4/15/2023 12:00:00 AM","2/29/2028 12:00:00 AM","Kidney and Urological Systems Function and Dysfunction Study Section[KUFD]"," ","437368",

Disbalances of the neuromodulator serotonin have beenassociated with improper circuit formation in the brain and an increased likelihood of developing cognitivedisabilities; characterizing the role of serotonin in proper synaptic development will help further our understandingof the cellular and molecular etiologies of developmental disorders.","15682413","OGELMAN, ROBERTO ","Not Applicable","06","PHARMACOLOGY","041096314","MW8JHK6ZYEX8","041096314","MW8JHK6ZYEX8","US","39.745098","-104.837605","1199905","UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER","Aurora","CO","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","800452571","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2024 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2024 12:00:00 AM","865","Training, Individual","2024","12539"," ","NICHD","12539","0"," ","NICHD","10805404","4/24/2024 12:00:00 AM","PA-21-051","5F31HD106632-03","5","F31","HD","106632","03"," ","PARISI, MELISSA","4/1/2022 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2024 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-F03A-T(20)L]"," ","12539",

The work is relevant topublic health because of (1) the epidemic rise in HPV-associated oral malignancies and because this represents(2) the development of the first FDA BEST-defined monitoring biomarker of any kind for oral sequelae of cancertherapy generally and the first-ever validated FDA BEST-defined monitoring imaging biomarker of any dentaldisease process. The innovative research described in this proposal can drive significant change in clinicalpractice for head and neck cancer by improving survivorship through normal tissue sparing and prevention oflong-term toxicity while maintaining excellent disease control which always represents a major healthcarechallenge.","1880052","LAI, STEPHEN Y","FULLER, CLIFTON DAVID","09","SURGERY","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","US","29.706319","-95.397195","578407","UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR","HOUSTON","TX","HOSPITALS","770304009","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2024 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2025 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2024","687801"," ","NIDCR","584281","316573"," ","NIDCR","10793625","1/4/2024 12:00:00 AM","PAR-20-060","5U01DE032168-02","5","U01","DE","032168","02"," ","CHEN, ZHONG","4/1/2023 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2028 12:00:00 AM","ZDE1-YM(07)"," ","687801",

Data suggest that OS may be particularly vulnerable to targeting ofmetabolic pathways; indeed I have shown that loss of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 1 and 4 function inOS cells leads to intracellular lactate accumulation altering tumor cell phenotype and impairing aerobic glycolysis.Building upon these data I will employ a comparative cross-species approach to define the regulation andfunction of MCT1/4 in OS assess the therapeutic potential of MCT inhibition using zebrafish and mouse modelsof OS and explore strategies for synthetic lethality ultimately creating a blueprint for future clinical translation.","14820234","GARDNER, HEATHER LYNN","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","039318308","C1F5LNUF7W86","039318308","C1F5LNUF7W86","US","42.3498","-71.06149","8422704","TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON","BOSTON","MA","Domestic Higher Education","021111901","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2024 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2025 12:00:00 AM","351","Other Research-Related","2024","126252"," ","OD","116900","9352"," ","OD","10783007","2/2/2024 12:00:00 AM","PA-19-126","5K01OD028268-05","5","K01","OD","028268","05"," ","TANDON, RITESH","3/1/2020 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2025 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-IMST-U(80)S]"," ","126252",

The goal ofthis proposal is to dissect the mechanisms of FCRLA-mediated inhibition of class II-restricted CD4+ T cellrecognition of B-cell lymphomas in vitro and in vivo by employing genetically manipulated lymphoma cellsantigen-specific T cells and FCRLA blocking antibody. The proposed study will determine whether FCRLAshedding plays a significant role in modulating the activity of CD4+ T cells and if blocking of FCRLAaugments antitumor immunity. Overall these studies will elucidate novel mechanisms for restoringimmune detection of lymphoid malignancy which will likely spur development of novel therapeuticstrategies for B-cell lymphomas that may be applicable to other malignancies. The success of this projectwill also profoundly improve the treatment and survivorship of Veterans and their family members.","6729216","HAQUE, AZIZUL ","Not Applicable","06","Unavailable","039807318","WRERXDACNQ31","039807318","WRERXDACNQ31","US","32.784055","-79.954022","481111","RALPH H JOHNSON VA MEDICAL CENTER","CHARLESTON","SC","Independent Hospitals","294015703","UNITED STATES","N","10/1/2023 12:00:00 AM","9/30/2024 12:00:00 AM","999","Non-SBIR/STTR","2024"," "," "," "," "," "," ","VA","10701531","10/13/2023 12:00:00 AM","RFA-BX-22-001","1I01BX006101-01A1","1","I01","BX","006101","01","A1"," ","10/1/2023 12:00:00 AM","9/30/2027 12:00:00 AM","ZRD1-IMMA-G(01)"," "," ",

It can be incitedby neurotoxic drugs chronic age-related conditions such as diabetes and kidney failure and trauma amongother etiologies. Current therapies to treat peripheral neuropathy are largely ineffective thereby renderingprevention particularly important. However there are currently no good methods to identify patients at high riskof developing neuropathy as risk factors beyond the inciting agents are poorly understood. Aging as a risk factorappears central to neuropathy progression; however clinical data regarding the contribution of aging areconflicting possibly due to the heterogeneity of the aging process. In contrast Sapere Bio utilizes measurementsof senescence a hallmark of cellular aging to understand individual vulnerabilities due to aging process. In thisproposal we will measure senescence and a list of other biomarkers and develop a model to predict risk ofchemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in early breast cancer patients. When completed ourdiagnostic will provide an essential clinical-decision tool to guide treatment in breast cancer.","11278569","MITIN, NATALIA ","Not Applicable","04","Unavailable","078862069","Q3LKKRH87ES9","078862069","Q3LKKRH87ES9","US","35.952448","-79.086499","10034434","SAPERE BIO, INC.","DURHAM","NC","Domestic For-Profits","277093075","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2023 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2025 12:00:00 AM","866","SBIR/STTR","2023","110740"," ","NIA","73925","29570"," ","NIA","10673718","8/8/2023 12:00:00 AM","PA-20-260","5R44AG072994-03","5","R44","AG","072994","03"," ","FRANKOWSKI, DAVID WITT","9/15/2021 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2025 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-ETTN-A(13)B]"," ","110740",

The proposed project aims to develop a novel analytic method to modifytraditional polygenic risk scores i.e. individual scores quantifying genetic risk for disease based on resultsfrom genetic association studies so that these risk scores account for established genetic risk signals seen inlarge general population studies and the modifying effects of specific cancer therapies. The proposed project isrelevant to public health as it formulates new treatment-specific genetic risk predictors that can ultimatelyenhance plans for individualized care (e.g. informing screening frequencies/modalities andprevention/intervention strategies) for survivors at greatest risk for developing late effects.","16344565","IM, CINDY ","YUAN, YAN ","05","PEDIATRICS","555917996","KABJZBBJ4B54","555917996","KABJZBBJ4B54","US","44.975143","-93.227003","1450402","UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA","MINNEAPOLIS","MN","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","554552070","UNITED STATES","N","9/9/2022 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2025 12:00:00 AM","393","Non-SBIR/STTR","2021","256537"," ","NCI","242920","13617"," ","NCI","10665850","9/12/2022 12:00:00 AM","PA-21-268","7R21CA261833-02","7","R21","CA","261833","02"," ","SHELBURNE, NONNIEKAYE F","9/1/2021 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2025 12:00:00 AM","ZCA1-SRB-T(M1)"," ","256537",
